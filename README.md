## Description

Android Project using Java. Complete example to show how to create relational persistence data using Room. 
We are going to store user events. Our application is aimed to manage (CRUD) operations of events. 

- Create: The application must be able to insert a new user event to the DB.
- Delete: The application must be able to delete an event. We are going to use the swipe gesture to delete items.
- Read: The application must be able to get all events or filter events by userId.
